## About that project
Project for the purpose of study.
The goal is to have an app with users who register on the platform and can upload their photos with animals, and the app recognizes the animal through artificial intelligence (ml5).

## What can this app can do now
The app now had roules for users: normal and admin. The normal user can upload his photos (the ai recognizes the image, the image is uploaded and the data of it are saved) and users can saw it. The admin can block the normal users, they are not deleted but blocked, so that they cannot create a new account with that email.

## Future implementations
- user registration
- admin can manage photos, in case they are not appropriate and show the hidden images
- create script for hide photos not appropriate in base of the name (exploits cron)

## Status
developing
